To build the 'ncui' binary from the juniper distribution, do the following:

1. Get the juniper dist

One is included here, but you can also simply use a browser to try to log in
from a linux box.  It should drop a copy of the client in your home directory,
~/.juniper/network_connect.  Everything you need is there.

2. Install dependencies

Use apt, yum, or the package management system of choice for your distro.  On
debian, it looks like this:

apt-get install gcc-multilib

3. Invoke GCC on the shared object file

You should have libncui.so.  From the directory which contains libncui.so,
invoke gcc like so:

gcc -m32 -Wl,-rpath,`pwd` -o ncui libncui.so

It is important you run this command in the same directory as the libncui.so
file, and you keep the shared object file as well as the binary in the same
directory.

4. Generate the SSL cert for your host:

Run this:

openssl s_client -connect (your host):443 2>&1

Take the output between '-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-' and '-END CERTIFICATE-' and pipe
it to this command:

openssl x509 -outform der > ssl.crt

now ssl.crt will be in the correct format.

5. The command line client is executed like this:

ncui -h somehost -c DSID=nnnnnn.... -f ssl.crt
